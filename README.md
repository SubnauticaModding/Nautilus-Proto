## About

Formerly known as [SMLHelper](https://github.com/SubnauticaModding/SMLHelper), Nautilus is a modding library that aims to enhance developer productivity by offering common helper utilities as easy to use and robust as possible. Noteable systems which Nautilis offers inlcude: Adding/editing items, implementing custom sprites & textures, playing custom audio, a 'Mods' tab in the games 'Options' which easily allows you to have in-game configuration for your mods. Though most importantly, Nautilis is used to bring mods together with a common platform/library, and in general making modders lives easier. More on what Nautilus can do is available in the [documentation](https://subnauticamodding.github.io/Nautilus).
