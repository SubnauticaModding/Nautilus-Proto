## About
Nautilus is a modding library that aims on enhancing developer productivity by offering common helper utilities as easy to use and robust as possible.

Nautilus offers systems such as adding/editing items, icons, spawns, sounds and so much more!

## Installation
1. Download [BepInEx](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1108).  
   Install it by extracting the content of the zip into your Subnautica folder (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica`)
2. Download Nautilus from either [Nexus Mods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), [Submodica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or GitHub Releases.  
   Drag and drop the `plugins` folder in the zip into your BepInEx folder.
